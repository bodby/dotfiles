# Dotfiles

Originally from Gentoo Linux but these aren't system configuration files so it doesn't matter.

Dotfiles for:

- Hyprland.
- Neovim.
- Aylur's GTK Shell.
- Fish.
- Foot.
- Kitty (unused).
- FZF.
- XDG user dirs.
- Waybar (unused).

Will be focusing on moving to NixOS, and later update this repo.

## Other resources

These aren't included in the repo:

- Lilex Nerd Font.
- Intone Mono Nerd Font.
- Google Dot cursor.

These are, *temporarily*:

- Wallpaper.
